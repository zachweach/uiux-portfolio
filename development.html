        <h1>Development</h1>
        <p>This project features an interactive interface using interface components and several internal data states. Using React, this list-based interface expands on <a href="https://cab.brown.edu/">Courses @ Brown</a>, which allows students at Brown University to browse course offerings.</p>

        <h2>Design choices</h2>
        <h3>Displaying the list of courses</h3>
        <p>Each course is displayed using a card component, which takes in React props to display the proper course information and image.</p>
        <p>The data for each course is currently pulled from a local file, but could support reading any JSON file, including one pulled from the internet or an API.</p>
        <h3>Sorting and Filtering</h3>
        <p>The user can filter by department and course level and can sort by a variety of criteria, some of which is gathered from <a href="https://thecriticalreview.org">The Critical Review</a>.</p>
        <p>In order to keep track of all of the conditions that the user wants to filter and sort by, a state is used that contains a list of all the currently applied filters and sort.</p>
        <p>By default, no boxes are checked, and the list can be reset using the "All" filters and sorting by course number, which is the defualt.</p>
