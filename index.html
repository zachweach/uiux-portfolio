        <h2>Welcome to my Portfolio!</h2>
        <p>Here, I'm showcasing some of the work that I've done in User Interfaces and User Experience design. Please check out some of these featured projects!</p>
        <p>Each project page will walk you through each step of the process of completing each project.</p>
        <h3>What's my deal?</h3>
        <p>One of my favorite "ice breakers" is to ask someone "what's your deal?" and see how they naturally respond. Here's how I'd respond in the context of this portfolio.</p>
        <p>As a dual concentrator in Computer Science and Cognitive Neuroscience, I'm interested in the way humans interact with machines and software. As such, I'm very interested in accessibility (check out how this page does using <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/report#/zachweach.github.io/uiux-portfolio">WAVE (the web accessibility evaluation tool)</a>.</p>
        <p>I'm always down to talk about accessibility, anything computers, or your favorite musical! You can reach me at <a href="mailto:zachary_weachter@brown.edu">zachary_weachter@brown.edu</a> to get in contact.</p>
